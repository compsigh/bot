# Compsigh Bot

## TODO:
- move petfaadil count and workingon data to a database
  - edward suggested postgres
- restrict which servers/channels the bot can be used in
- consider switching to utilizing discord.js fully
  - code is a bit cleaner
  - might also make it easier to fix the attachment bug
- need a more creative name for the bot...
- remove test command
